# Requirements Document

## Introduction

QuantumFlow by eliomatters is an innovative compression algorithm that leverages quantum mechanical principles (superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference) simulated on conventional computers to achieve superior compression ratios compared to traditional algorithms. Unlike Pied Piper's middle-out compression, this approach uses quantum-inspired mathematical models to represent data in quantum state spaces, potentially achieving exponential compression improvements through quantum parallelism simulation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to compress files using quantum-inspired algorithms, so that I can achieve better compression ratios than traditional methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a file for compression THEN the system SHALL apply quantum superposition simulation to represent data states
2. WHEN the quantum compression algorithm processes data THEN the system SHALL achieve at least 15% better compression ratio than gzip
3. WHEN compression is complete THEN the system SHALL output a compressed file with quantum metadata
4. IF the input file is larger than 1GB THEN the system SHALL process it in quantum-simulated chunks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to decompress quantum-compressed files, so that I can retrieve my original data with perfect fidelity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides a quantum-compressed file THEN the system SHALL read the quantum metadata to reconstruct the original data
2. WHEN decompression occurs THEN the system SHALL use quantum interference patterns to reconstruct the original file
3. WHEN decompression is complete THEN the system SHALL verify that the output matches the original file exactly (bit-for-bit)
4. IF the compressed file is corrupted THEN the system SHALL detect quantum state inconsistencies and report the error

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to analyze the QuantumFlow performance metrics, so that I can understand the algorithm's effectiveness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN compression completes THEN the system SHALL report compression ratio, processing time, and quantum state efficiency
2. WHEN multiple files are processed THEN the system SHALL maintain performance statistics across sessions
3. WHEN quantum simulation parameters are adjusted THEN the system SHALL show how changes affect compression performance
4. IF performance degrades below baseline THEN the system SHALL suggest quantum parameter optimizations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a power user, I want to configure quantum simulation parameters, so that I can optimize compression for different data types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses configuration THEN the system SHALL provide options for quantum bit depth, entanglement levels, and superposition complexity
2. WHEN parameters are modified THEN the system SHALL validate that they remain within computational feasibility bounds
3. WHEN custom profiles are created THEN the system SHALL save and allow reuse of quantum parameter sets
4. IF invalid parameters are set THEN the system SHALL prevent execution and suggest valid alternatives

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want QuantumFlow to integrate with existing workflows, so that it can be used in automated processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN called via command line THEN the system SHALL accept standard compression tool arguments and flags
2. WHEN integrated into scripts THEN the system SHALL return appropriate exit codes for success/failure states
3. WHEN processing multiple files THEN the system SHALL support batch operations with progress reporting
4. IF system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL gracefully reduce quantum simulation complexity

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access QuantumFlow through a web interface, so that I can compress files without installing software locally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the web platform THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive interface for file upload and compression
2. WHEN uploading files THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop functionality with real-time progress indicators
3. WHEN compression completes THEN the system SHALL allow direct download of compressed files
4. IF files exceed size limits THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a business user, I want to integrate QuantumFlow with cloud storage services, so that I can compress files directly from my cloud accounts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting to cloud storage THEN the system SHALL support integration with AWS S3, Google Drive, and Dropbox
2. WHEN processing cloud files THEN the system SHALL compress files in-place or save to specified locations
3. WHEN batch processing THEN the system SHALL handle multiple cloud files with queue management
4. IF authentication fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear re-authentication prompts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a remote worker, I want to use video conferencing with quantum compression, so that I can have high-quality calls with minimal bandwidth usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN joining a video call THEN the system SHALL apply real-time quantum compression to video streams
2. WHEN network conditions change THEN the system SHALL adaptively adjust compression quality to maintain call stability
3. WHEN multiple participants join THEN the system SHALL optimize bandwidth usage across all connections
4. IF compression fails THEN the system SHALL gracefully fall back to standard video compression

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a meeting organizer, I want to create and manage video conference rooms, so that I can host quantum-compressed video meetings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a meeting room THEN the system SHALL generate unique room codes and access links
2. WHEN participants join THEN the system SHALL support screen sharing with quantum-compressed streams
3. WHEN recording meetings THEN the system SHALL store recordings with quantum compression for space efficiency
4. IF room capacity is exceeded THEN the system SHALL queue additional participants or suggest alternative rooms
