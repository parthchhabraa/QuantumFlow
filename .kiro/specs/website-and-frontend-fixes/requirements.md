# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses multiple critical issues with the quantum compression simulator project: creating a professional showcase website, fixing compression efficiency problems, resolving frontend download functionality, and correcting UI corruption issues that prevent proper decompression functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a visitor to the project, I want to see a professional showcase website that explains what the quantum compression simulator is and demonstrates its capabilities, so that I can understand the project's value and features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the website THEN the system SHALL display a landing page with project overview, features, and benefits
2. WHEN a user navigates the website THEN the system SHALL provide clear sections for documentation, demo, and technical details
3. WHEN a user views the website THEN the system SHALL showcase compression performance metrics and use cases
4. WHEN a user accesses the website THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user compressing files, I want the compression to actually reduce file size rather than increase it, so that I can achieve the intended space savings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user compresses a 2MB file THEN the system SHALL produce a compressed file smaller than the original
2. WHEN compression is performed THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity while reducing file size
3. WHEN compression fails to reduce size THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback about why compression was ineffective
4. WHEN compression algorithms run THEN the system SHALL optimize for actual size reduction rather than theoretical quantum states

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the frontend application, I want to download my actual uploaded file after compression/decompression, not the HTML source code, so that I can retrieve my processed data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a file for compression THEN the system SHALL process the actual file content
2. WHEN a user clicks download after compression THEN the system SHALL provide the compressed version of their uploaded file
3. WHEN a user clicks download after decompression THEN the system SHALL provide the original file content
4. WHEN download is triggered THEN the system SHALL use proper MIME types and file extensions for the downloaded content

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user of the frontend application, I want to see and use the decompression functionality, so that I can restore compressed files to their original state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user loads the frontend application THEN the system SHALL display both compression and decompression tabs
2. WHEN a user clicks the decompression tab THEN the system SHALL show the decompression interface
3. WHEN a user uploads a compressed file THEN the system SHALL provide decompression functionality
4. WHEN decompression is performed THEN the system SHALL restore the original file content accurately
5. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL not have any JavaScript errors that prevent tab functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer or user, I want the frontend application to work without corruption or missing functionality, so that all features are accessible and functional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend application loads THEN the system SHALL display all UI components without visual corruption
2. WHEN a user interacts with the interface THEN the system SHALL respond appropriately without errors
3. WHEN navigation occurs between tabs THEN the system SHALL maintain proper state and display
4. WHEN the application runs THEN the system SHALL have no console errors that affect functionality
