# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Create website structure and basic pages
  - Create `/website` directory with HTML structure for landing page
  - Implement responsive navigation and hero section
  - Add quantum-themed CSS with glassmorphism effects and particle animations
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_

- [x] 2. Fix compression algorithm to actually reduce file size
  - Modify `QuantumCompressionEngine.ts` to implement real compression instead of storing original data
  - Add hybrid compression strategy that combines classical algorithms with quantum optimization
  - Remove the `originalData` storage that causes file size increase
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 3. Implement proper file download functionality in frontend
  - Fix `FileUpload.tsx` and `FileDecompress.tsx` to process actual file content instead of creating empty links
  - Replace `href="#"` with proper blob URLs generated from processed file data
  - Add correct MIME type detection and file extension handling
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4_

- [x] 4. Fix frontend UI corruption and missing decompression tab
  - Debug and fix CSS styling issues that may be hiding the decompression tab
  - Ensure proper tab switching functionality in `App.tsx`
  - Add error boundaries to prevent JavaScript errors from breaking the UI
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_

- [ ] 5. Add website demo and documentation pages
  - Create interactive demo page that showcases compression functionality
  - Add documentation pages explaining the quantum compression technology
  - Implement API reference page with usage examples
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_

- [ ] 6. Implement compression validation and fallback mechanisms
  - Add size validation to reject compression results larger than original
  - Implement fallback to classical compression when quantum algorithms fail
  - Add data integrity verification for compress/decompress cycles
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [ ] 7. Add comprehensive error handling and user feedback
  - Implement proper error messages for file upload and processing failures
  - Add loading states and progress indicators for better user experience
  - Create error recovery mechanisms for failed operations
  - _Requirements: 3.4, 4.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 8. Create automated tests for compression and frontend functionality
  - Write unit tests for compression algorithm fixes
  - Add integration tests for file upload/download workflows
  - Create end-to-end tests for complete user scenarios
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 4.1, 4.2_

- [ ] 9. Optimize performance and memory usage
  - Implement memory management for large file processing
  - Add performance monitoring and optimization for compression algorithms
  - Optimize frontend rendering and file handling
  - _Requirements: 2.4, 3.4, 5.4_

- [ ] 10. Final integration and cross-browser testing
  - Test complete workflows across different browsers and devices
  - Verify website responsiveness and accessibility compliance
  - Validate compression ratios and data integrity across various file types
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 2.1, 3.1, 4.1, 5.1_
