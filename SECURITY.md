## Security Considerations

QuantumFlow handles sensitive data through compression and video conferencing features. We take security seriously and have implemented multiple layers of protection.

### Data Security

#### Compression Security
- **Data Integrity**: All compressed data includes integrity checksums
- **Metadata Protection**: Quantum metadata is encrypted during storage
- **Memory Safety**: Secure memory handling prevents data leaks
- **Temporary Files**: Automatic cleanup of temporary compression files

#### Video Conferencing Security
- **End-to-End Encryption**: WebRTC provides encrypted peer-to-peer communication
- **Room Access Control**: Secure room codes and participant authentication
- **Recording Consent**: Explicit consent required for meeting recordings
- **Data Retention**: Configurable data retention policies for recordings and chat

#### API Security
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured cross-origin resource sharing
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of security headers (CSP, HSTS, etc.)

### Infrastructure Security

#### Network Security
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Secure WebSocket**: WSS for real-time communication
- **Certificate Validation**: Proper SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Network Isolation**: Proper network segmentation in deployment

#### File System Security
- **Path Traversal Protection**: Prevention of directory traversal attacks
- **File Type Validation**: Strict file type and size validation
- **Sandboxing**: Isolated processing environments for file operations
- **Permission Management**: Minimal required file system permissions

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Validate and sanitize inputs
function compressFile(filename: string, data: Buffer): CompressionResult {
  if (!isValidFilename(filename)) {
    throw new Error('Invalid filename');
  }
  if (data.length > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error('File too large');
  }
  // Process safely...
}

// ❌ Bad: No validation
function compressFile(filename: any, data: any) {
  // Direct processing without validation
}
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Don't leak sensitive information
try {
  await processQuantumData(data);
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Compression failed', { error: error.message });
  throw new Error('Compression failed');
}

// ❌ Bad: Leaking internal details
try {
  await processQuantumData(data);
} catch (error) {
  throw error; // May contain sensitive paths or data
}
```

#### Secure Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Pin dependency versions in production
- Review dependency licenses and security policies

### Video Security

#### WebRTC Security
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Secure peer connection configuration
const rtcConfig: RTCConfiguration = {
  iceServers: [
    { urls: 'stun:stun.l.google.com:19302' },
    {
      urls: 'turn:your-turn-server.com:3478',
      username: 'user',
      credential: 'pass'
    }
  ],
  iceCandidatePoolSize: 10,
  bundlePolicy: 'max-bundle',
  rtcpMuxPolicy: 'require'
};
```

#### Room Security
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Secure room code generation
function generateRoomCode(): string {
  return crypto.randomBytes(6).toString('hex').toUpperCase();
}

// ❌ Bad: Predictable room codes
function generateRoomCode(): string {
  return Date.now().toString();
}
```

### API Security

#### Authentication
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Proper JWT validation
const authenticateToken = (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
  const authHeader = req.headers['authorization'];
  const token = authHeader && authHeader.split(' ')[1];
  
  if (!token) {
    return res.sendStatus(401);
  }
  
  jwt.verify(token, process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET!, (err, user) => {
    if (err) return res.sendStatus(403);
    req.user = user;
    next();
  });
};
```

#### Rate Limiting
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Implement rate limiting
const compressionLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 10, // Limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many compression requests, please try again later.'
});

app.use('/api/compress', compressionLimiter);
```

## Security Testing
